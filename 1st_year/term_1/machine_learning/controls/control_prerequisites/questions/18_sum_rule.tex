\section{Sum rule}
Suppose we have two r.v.-s $X$ and $Y$. We can define the joint distribution of two r.v.-s using $P(x,y) = P(X = x \cap Y = y)$ for all possible values of $X$ and $Y$. Given a joint distribution, we define the marginal distribution of an r.v. as follows:
\[
    P(X = x) = \sum\limits_y P(X = x \cap Y = y),
\]
where we are summing over all possible states of $Y$. This is sometimes called sum rule or the rule of total probability.
