\section{Mean. Mode. Median}

\subsection*{Mode}
The mode of a distribution is the value with the highest probability mass or probability density function:
\[
    x^* = \argmax{x}{p(x)}
\]
This may not be unique, in such cases the distribution is called multimodal Furthermore, even if there is a unique mode, this point may not be a good summary of the distribution.
